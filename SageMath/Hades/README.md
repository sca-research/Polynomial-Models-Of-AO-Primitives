# Hades
This directory contains [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) implementations of the polynomial models for [Hades](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45724-2_23) with a multivariate key.

In the Notebook [Hades.ipynb](./Hades.ipynb) a DRL Gr√∂bner basis is computed by inverting the matrix in every round.

## Requirements
- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) 10.5.

## Usage
For usage examples of the various instances see [Hades.ipynb](./Hades.ipynb).
